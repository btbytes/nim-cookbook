This Cookbook is not a [tutorial](https://nim-lang.org/docs/tut1.html) on learning Nim, neither is it aimed at [introducing Nim](http://howistart.org/posts/nim/1/index.html) to programmers. It is for people who are familiar with [Nim syntax](https://nim-lang.org/docs/manual.html).

It is for people who want to figure out how to put together what they know about Nim with a problem they want to solve to write a program.
After all, there is nothing like writing an actual program to learn a new programming language.


Effort is made ensure that the code shown here is correct and compiles to produce the desired result. You can look at the ["code"](https://github.com/btbytes/nim-cookbook/tree/master/code) directory for the complete source listing.
